    abstract = {We survey the main formulations and solution methods for two-dimensional orthogonal cutting and packing problems, where both items and bins are rectangles. We focus on exact methods and relaxations for the four main problems from the literature: finding a packing with minimum height, packing the items into the minimum number of bins, finding a packing of maximum value, and determining the existence of a feasible packing.}
